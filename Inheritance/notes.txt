1.Inheritance is a mechanism where a child class (subclass) inherits properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from a 
parent class (superclass). It helps to implement code reusability and hierarchy and also method overriding

2.The keyword super is used to access the constructor of the super class. Also it is used to access the super class methods or fields
hidden by the subclass

3. The keyword extends is used to inherit or establish an inheritance relation between two classes (is-a) relation.
class child extends parent


4.static methods in Java belong to the class, not the object.

When a static method is re-declared in a subclass with the same signature, it hides the superclass method rather than overriding it.

In this line:

java
Copy
Edit
A obj = new B();
obj.show();   // calls A.show(), not B.show()
The method show() is resolved at compile time based on the reference type, which is A, not the actual object type (B).

So A.show() is called, printing "A".
